                bike that adapts to your life—not the other way around. A bike that restores your confidence,

                That's why Loopzo doesn't build bikes on an assembly line, but creates unique, tailor-made
                solutions. These range from tricycles, scooter bikes, wheelchair bikes, tandem bikes, double
                rider bikes to low step through bikes. Each model is also available as an electric bike
                (Pedelec).
